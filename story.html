<p>My one of the favourite character is Birbal from Akbar and Birbal shot stories....He is so intelligent and clever...He solve problems so easily and teaches us to be clever,intelligent,smart and kind..
 He uses his intelligence and cleverness wisely...I always try to make short stories like this..Birbal was mostly entitled to the administrative and military duties, but was very close to Akbar who loved his wisdom, sense of humor and subtle wit. Birbal was moreover a poet and an author. Equally loved by children and the adults, generations have grown up listening to the folk lores of Birbal and Akbar.
 I never get bored while reading Akbar and birbal tales..he has a sharp mind..he can make understand everything with easy steps....I always love stories that how birbal used his clever mind and  used to solve tricky situations..I always try to write such short stories which can help us in daily life..</p>
